A simple key logger written in go.

## Disclaimer
This intention of this exercise is purely educational. The aim is to understand Go and its libraries better while making some fun stuff.

## Current status
Right now, all it does is use the [eiannone/keyboard](https://github.com/eiannone/keyboard) library to listen to key strokes and save it to a text file.

## ToDO
Add more useful features like:
> Send the recorded keystrokes over email.
> Improve performance so that it consumes system resources minimally and stay under the radar.

## Expected goal(s) out of this activity/project
> Get to understand Go better.
> Learn how to use some of the libraries like os, os/exec, syscall, etc.
